# Note

## Regularized logistic regression
1. Parameter theta(0) shouldn't be regularized.(in Octave/Matlab, the index is from 1, so we should write like [this](./costFunctionReg.m))
2. Notice the dimension of matrices when operate them.
3. Small lambda will causes overfitting while large lambda can cause underfitting.
